## Contributing

Hello, feel free to make changes to this repository and try to add new features and clean up
1. One feature that i thought was to use a scoreboard to keep track of the wins and losses of players
2. One clean-up process would be to reduce the number of lines in the isWinner() and optimize it
3. Add anything that you feel would progress this app
